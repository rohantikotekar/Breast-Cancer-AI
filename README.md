# Anomaly Detection and Clustering Analysis
### This project showcases a robust data preprocessing and analysis pipeline combining Isolation Forest for anomaly detection and KMeans++ for clustering.

# Key Features:
#### Anomaly Detection: Identified and filtered outliers using Isolation Forest with a contamination rate of 10%.
#### Dynamic Thresholding: Experimented with percentile-based thresholds (1%, 5%, 10%, 15%) to optimize anomaly removal.
#### Clustering: Applied KMeans++ algorithm for efficient and accurate clustering of filtered datasets.
#### Data Normalization: Standardized features using StandardScaler for consistent input to machine learning models.
#### Performance Metrics: Evaluated results with inertia and silhouette scores, visualized through interactive plots.

# Technologies Used:
#### Python: Core programming language for the entire pipeline.
#### Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

# Results: 
#### Demonstrated the impact of anomaly removal on clustering performance with detailed visualizations and metrics.
#### Achieved improved clustering outcomes through iterative data refinement.
